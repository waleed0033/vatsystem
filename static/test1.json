    "name":"Garden is part of our life to have in a house or backyard. Could be flowers or tomatoes for example. Our project objective is to make gardening easier to the people whom think it is hard and time consuming for them. In our TechGarden you can monitor your garden information (temperature, humidity, water level and monitor your garden in real time). Also, it will gather information from all these sensors and upload it to database to decide what to grow in what season and in your area, based on the information that all collected in the database. The garden watering system will be able to decide when to water the garden and when not based on the area weather forecast if it is hot day, rainy day or even if the owner decided to water it himself. All information we collect we will make use of it. TechGarden is helping and educating people on gardening indoor at home, work and anywhere. We are using technology in our advantage to help water the garden and collect data from the gardens to improve and educate people on what to grow as well as what can grow together!",
